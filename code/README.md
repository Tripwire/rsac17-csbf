# Example Code for CSBF

## CSBFGenerator.py
This file demonstrates the automated creation of a text-based CSBF Bulletin. 

## CVRFParser.py
This file contains a complete parser for the CVRF format. It has been tested on CVRF from both Microsoft and Cisco. 

**Known Issues:**
- JSON import has not been tested or fully implemented.

## MSCVRFParser.py
This file will pull a Microsoft Document by ID on import and generate a CSBF Bulletin from the CVRF file. You must fill in a valid API key under configuration where the invalid key is currently listed.
